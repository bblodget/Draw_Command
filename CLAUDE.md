# Draw Command: Speech-to-Drawing Demo - Project Overview

## Project Description

This project recreates the iconic 1980s TI professional computer demo where users could draw and manipulate shapes on screen using voice commands. The system responds to sophisticated natural language instructions like "computer draw a red square please" and "computer move the square to the left of the circle please" to create an interactive voice-controlled drawing experience.
