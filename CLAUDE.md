# Draw Command: Speech-to-Drawing Demo - Project Overview

## Project Description

This project recreates the iconic 1980s TI professional computer demo where users could draw and manipulate shapes on screen using voice commands. The system responds to natural language instructions like "computer draw a red square please" and "computer move the square to the left please" to create an interactive voice-controlled drawing experience.

### Key Features
- **Voice Recognition**: Real-time speech-to-text using Web Speech API
- **Natural Language Processing**: AI-powered command parsing with OpenAI GPT-4
- **Interactive Canvas**: HTML5 Canvas with Fabric.js for shape manipulation
- **Voice Responses**: Text-to-speech confirmation and feedback
- **Context Awareness**: Understands references like "it" and "the red square"

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Voice**: Web Speech API (recognition + synthesis)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 for natural language processing
- **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas + Fabric.js
- **Deployment**: Vercel (hosting + serverless functions)

## Project Documentation

### Core Documentation

#### `docs/requirements.md`
**Purpose**: Defines what the system should do from a user's perspective
- Functional requirements (voice commands, canvas features, responses)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, usability, security)
- User experience requirements (voice interaction, visual interface)
- Success criteria for the project

**When to use**: Reference when making design decisions or adding new features to ensure alignment with project goals.

#### `docs/specification.md`
**Purpose**: Technical implementation details and architecture decisions
- Technology stack and rationale
- System architecture and data flow
- API design and interfaces
- Component structure and organization
- Security considerations and performance optimization

**When to use**: Reference when implementing features, making technical decisions, or understanding how components interact.

#### `docs/plan.md`
**Purpose**: Detailed development roadmap with incremental tasks
- Three-phase development approach (Core → AI → Advanced)
- Bite-sized tasks (2-6 hours each) with clear acceptance criteria
- Testing strategy for each phase
- Timeline estimates and success metrics

**When to use**: Reference when starting development work, tracking progress, or planning development sessions.

#### `docs/development-workflow.md`
**Purpose**: Defines how we collaborate and maintain code quality
- Session-based development process
- Task-by-task approval workflow
- Branch management and merge strategies
- Testing requirements and quality assurance

**When to use**: Reference when starting new development sessions, committing code, or managing project workflow.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (25-30 hours)
**Goal**: Basic voice-to-drawing demo
- Project setup and React app
- Basic canvas with shape drawing
- Voice recognition and attention word detection
- Simple command parsing (regex-based)
- Voice-to-canvas connection
- Basic voice responses
- UI polish and testing

**Deliverable**: Working demo that can draw shapes with voice commands

### Phase 2: AI Enhancement (20-25 hours)
**Goal**: Natural language processing
- OpenAI API integration
- AI-powered command parsing
- Context awareness and references
- Advanced commands (spatial relationships, size modifications)
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Enhanced voice responses

**Deliverable**: Sophisticated natural language understanding

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (20-25 hours)
**Goal**: Professional demo capabilities
- Complex shapes and patterns
- Undo/redo system
- Export/import functionality
- Performance optimization
- Final polish and documentation

**Deliverable**: Presentation-ready demo with all features

## Getting Started

### For New Developers
1. Read `docs/requirements.md` to understand project goals
2. Review `docs/specification.md` for technical architecture
3. Check `docs/plan.md` for current development status
4. Follow `docs/development-workflow.md` for development process

### For Project Management
1. Use `docs/plan.md` to track progress and estimate timelines
2. Reference `docs/requirements.md` for feature prioritization
3. Use `docs/development-workflow.md` for quality assurance

### For Technical Decisions
1. Check `docs/specification.md` for existing architecture decisions
2. Update `docs/requirements.md` if new requirements are discovered
3. Modify `docs/specification.md` if technical decisions change

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Planning and Documentation
**Next Milestone**: Start Phase 1 development
**Estimated Completion**: 3-6 weeks (part-time development)

## Key Success Factors

1. **Voice Recognition Accuracy**: Must work reliably across browsers and speech patterns
2. **Natural Language Understanding**: AI should handle various command phrasings
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of system state and command processing
4. **Performance**: Responsive canvas and fast voice command processing
5. **Demo Quality**: Professional appearance suitable for presentations
