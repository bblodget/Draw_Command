This timeline assumes part-time development. Each phase can be completed independently, allowing for flexible scheduling and iteration based on feedback.

## Deployment Strategy

### Current State (Phase 1.5 Ready)
The project is **deployment-ready** for GitHub Pages right now:
- ‚úÖ **100% client-side** - No server dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Web Speech API** - Works on HTTPS (GitHub Pages provides HTTPS)
- ‚úÖ **Professional demo** - Fully functional voice-controlled drawing
- ‚úÖ **Portfolio-ready** - Great for showcasing and sharing

### Future Deployment Options

**Phase 2 Considerations**:
- **OpenAI API integration** requires serverless functions
- **Options**: Migrate to Vercel/Netlify or use hybrid approach
- **Recommendation**: Deploy current version to GitHub Pages, then migrate for Phase 2

**Best Approach**:
1. **Now**: Deploy Phase 1 demo to GitHub Pages for immediate showcase
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate to Vercel for serverless function support
3. **Benefit**: Get public demo live while continuing development
