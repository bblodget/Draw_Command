### ‚úÖ Task 1.9.6: Fix Shape Size Preservation During Color Changes (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Preserve custom shape sizes when changing colors instead of resetting to default size.

**Background**: 
When a user resizes a shape (e.g., "make the square bigger") and then changes its color (e.g., "color the square blue"), the shape returns to its original default size instead of maintaining the custom size. This breaks the user's expectation that only the color should change.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Investigate current color change implementation in CanvasService
- [x] Identify why shape replacement resets size to default
- [x] Modify color change logic to preserve existing shape properties
- [x] Ensure position, size, and other properties are maintained during color changes

- [x] Add regression testing for property preservation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Changing shape color preserves custom size set by previous resize commands
- ‚úÖ Shape position remains unchanged during color modifications
- ‚úÖ Color changes work correctly after "make bigger/smaller" commands
- ‚úÖ Color changes work correctly after "same size as" commands
- ‚úÖ Voice responses accurately reflect that only color changed
- ‚úÖ No regression in existing color change functionality

**Completed**: 2025-07-12 | **Session**: `2025-07-12-1435-Task 1.9.6: Fix Shape Size Preservation During Color Changes.md`
**Actual Time**: 1 hour (within estimate)

**Root Cause & Solution**:
- **Issue**: Color command handler in App.tsx used hardcoded `size: 100` and `position: { x: 200, y: 200 }` instead of preserving existing shape properties
- **Fix**: Modified to call `canvas.getShapeByType()` to retrieve existing shape and preserve its size and position
- **Result**: Color changes now maintain custom sizes from resize operations while only changing color

**Technical Achievements**:
- **Property Preservation**: Size and position now maintained during color changes
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added checks for missing shapes during color operations
- **Zero Regression**: Existing color change functionality preserved
- **Build Verification**: Fix compiles successfully and passes build tests

### ‚úÖ Task 1.15: BNF Grammar Architecture (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Replace regex-based parsing with grammar-based parsing to support complex natural language commands and spatial relationships.

**Background**: 
During Task 1.12 session, we discovered that regex patterns have fundamental limitations for natural language processing. Commands like "make the triangle the same size as the rectangle" and "move the triangle to the left of the rectangle" require more sophisticated parsing than regex can provide. The current regex approach also suffers from pattern matching conflicts (e.g., the "make" command bug).

**Tasks**:
- [x] Research and select appropriate parsing library (Nearley.js, PEG.js, ANTLR, or Chevrotain)
- [x] Design BNF grammar for voice commands based on universal template
- [x] Implement grammar-based parser to replace CommandService regex patterns
- [x] Add support for spatial relationship commands ("to the left of", "above", "below")
- [x] Add support for complex size relationships ("same size as", "twice as big as")
- [x] Implement pronoun reference resolution within grammar
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [x] Test grammar parser with all existing commands for regression
- [x] Test new spatial relationship commands
- [x] Update voice commands documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive session documentation

## Phase 2: Final Polish

**Goal**: Address critical usability issues identified during testing to ensure a professional, demo-ready experience.

### Task 2.1: Fix Command Execution Reliability
**Goal**: Investigate and fix issue where transcript shows complete command but no action happens.

**Background**: Sometimes the transcript correctly displays the full command (e.g., "computer draw a red square please") but the system doesn't execute the command. This creates user confusion as the command appears to be recognized but nothing happens.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add detailed logging to track command flow from transcript to execution
- [ ] Investigate timing issues between transcript completion and command processing
- [ ] Check for race conditions in command detection logic
- [ ] Verify the command extraction from accumulated transcript is working correctly
- [ ] Test with various speaking speeds and pause patterns
- [ ] Implement fix for identified root cause
- [ ] Add safeguards to ensure commands are always processed when complete

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Every complete command shown in transcript executes reliably
- No commands are silently dropped or ignored
- Clear error messages if a command cannot be executed
- Consistent behavior across different speaking patterns

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### Task 2.2: Fix Transcript Continuity
**Goal**: Prevent transcript from being restarted mid-command.

**Background**: The transcript sometimes gets cleared/restarted while the user is still speaking a command, causing partial commands to be lost and breaking the user experience.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Investigate what triggers transcript restarts during active speech
- [ ] Check for unintended "computer" word detection mid-command
- [ ] Review speech recognition event handling for interruptions
- [ ] Implement proper command boundary detection
- [ ] Add debouncing or buffering to prevent premature resets
- [ ] Test with continuous speech and natural pauses

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Transcript maintains continuity throughout entire command
- Only "computer" at the start of a new command resets transcript
- Natural pauses within commands don't cause restarts
- Smooth experience for users speaking at different speeds

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### Task 2.3: Prevent Self-Hearing
**Goal**: Stop the computer's voice responses from being picked up by the transcript.

**Background**: When the system speaks its responses (e.g., "I drew a red square"), these words sometimes appear in the transcript, potentially triggering unintended commands or confusing the recognition system.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement microphone muting during text-to-speech playback
- [ ] Add proper synchronization between speech synthesis and recognition
- [ ] Test muting/unmuting timing to ensure no user speech is lost
- [ ] Consider adding visual indicator when system is speaking
- [ ] Ensure smooth transition between system speech and user input
- [ ] Test with various voice response lengths

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System voice responses never appear in transcript
- Microphone reactivates immediately after system finishes speaking
- No user speech is lost due to muting
- Clear visual feedback when system is speaking vs listening

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### Task 2.4: Improve Voice Control UI
**Goal**: Enhance the Voice Control box to show transcript area by default and optimize sizing.

**Background**: The Voice Control box currently doesn't show the transcript area until the user starts speaking, and the default sizing may not accommodate typical commands well.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Modify VoiceInterface to show empty transcript area on load
- [ ] Add placeholder text or hint in empty transcript area
- [ ] Calculate optimal default height based on typical command length
- [ ] Ensure transcript area can show 2-3 lines of text comfortably
- [ ] Test with various command lengths to verify sizing
- [ ] Maintain responsive design and draggability
- [ ] Add subtle visual cues for transcript area boundaries

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Transcript area visible immediately when page loads
- Default size accommodates most commands without scrolling
- Clear visual indication of where transcript will appear
- Responsive sizing that works on different screen sizes
- Maintains all existing UI functionality (dragging, controls)

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

---

### Task 2.5: Final Testing and Refinement
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing of all fixes and final polish.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test all Task 2.1-2.4 fixes work together harmoniously
- [ ] Verify no regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Test with multiple users to ensure consistent experience
- [ ] Address any edge cases discovered during testing
- [ ] Optimize performance if needed
- [ ] Update any documentation affected by changes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All polish fixes work correctly together
- No regression in core functionality
- Consistent, reliable experience across different users
- Professional, demo-ready quality
- All known issues resolved

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
