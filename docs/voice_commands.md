# Voice Commands Documentation

## Overview

The Draw Command application uses a **"Computer, [command] please"** format for voice recognition:
- **"Computer"** - Attention word that wakes up the system
- **"please"** - Execution word that triggers the command

## 🟢 Currently Supported Commands

## 📝 Error Handling

The system provides user-friendly error messages for:
- **Unrecognized commands**: "Could not understand the command. Try 'draw a red square' or 'clear'."
- **Canvas not ready**: "Canvas not ready"
- **Invalid colors**: Falls back to default colors
- **Voice recognition errors**: Displays specific error messages

## 🧪 Testing Commands

To test the system, try these basic commands:
1. "Computer, draw a red square please"
2. "Computer, draw a blue circle please"
3. "Computer, clear please"
4. "Computer, color the square blue please" (creates new blue square)
5. "Computer, move the square left please" (shows Phase 2 message)
