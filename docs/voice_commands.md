# Voice Commands Documentation

## Overview

The Draw Command application uses a **"Computer, [command] please"** format for voice recognition:
- **"Computer"** - Attention word that wakes up the system
- **"please"** - Execution word that triggers the command

## üéØ The Three Object Model

The Draw Command system operates on a simple principle: **only one shape of each type can exist at a time**.

### How It Works
- **One Square** - Only one square can exist on the canvas
- **One Circle** - Only one circle can exist on the canvas  
- **One Triangle** - Only one triangle can exist on the canvas

### What This Means
- When you draw a new square, it **replaces** any existing square
- When you change a shape's color, it **replaces** the old shape with a new colored version
- Each shape type is independent - you can have a square, circle, and triangle all at once
- This design eliminates ambiguity - "move the square" always refers to THE square

### Voice Feedback
The system provides intelligent voice responses:
- **New shape**: "I drew a blue square for you"
- **Replacing shape**: "I replaced the red square with a blue one"
- **Changing color**: "I changed the square to blue"

This simple model makes voice commands unambiguous and predictable, perfect for demonstration purposes.

## üü¢ Currently Supported Commands

### Drawing Shapes
These commands create shapes on the canvas (replacing any existing shape of the same type).
