# Voice Commands Documentation

## Overview

The Draw Command application uses a **"Computer, [command] please"** format for voice recognition:
- **"Computer"** - Attention word that wakes up the system
- **"please"** - Execution word that triggers the command

## üéØ The Three Object Model

The Draw Command system operates on a simple principle: **only one shape of each type can exist at a time**.

### How It Works
- **One Square** - Only one square can exist on the canvas
- **One Circle** - Only one circle can exist on the canvas  
- **One Triangle** - Only one triangle can exist on the canvas

### What This Means
- When you draw a new square, it **replaces** any existing square
- When you change a shape's color, it **replaces** the old shape with a new colored version
- Each shape type is independent - you can have a square, circle, and triangle all at once
- This design eliminates ambiguity - "move the square" always refers to THE square

### Voice Feedback
The system provides intelligent voice responses:
- **New shape**: "I drew a blue square for you"
- **Replacing shape**: "I replaced the red square with a blue one"
- **Changing color**: "I changed the square to blue"

This simple model makes voice commands unambiguous and predictable, perfect for demonstration purposes.

## üü¢ Currently Supported Commands

### Drawing Shapes
These commands create shapes on the canvas (replacing any existing shape of the same type).

| Command | Example | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|
| Draw Square | "Computer, draw a red square please" | ‚úÖ Full Support | Creates/replaces the square |
| Draw Circle | "Computer, draw a blue circle please" | ‚úÖ Full Support | Creates/replaces the circle |
| Draw Triangle | "Computer, draw a green triangle please" | ‚úÖ Full Support | Creates/replaces the triangle |

**Format Variations:**
- "draw a [color] [shape]" - with article
- "draw [color] [shape]" - without article
- "draw a [shape]" - default color (red for square, blue for circle, green for triangle)

### Canvas Management
These commands manage the overall canvas state.

| Command | Example | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|
| Clear Canvas | "Computer, clear please" | ‚úÖ Full Support | Removes all shapes |
| Clear All | "Computer, clear all please" | ‚úÖ Full Support | Same as clear |
| Clear Canvas | "Computer, clear the canvas please" | ‚úÖ Full Support | Same as clear |

### Color Commands
These commands change the color of existing shapes (or create new ones if none exist).

### Move Commands
These commands move shapes in the specified direction. Default distance is 50 pixels, but you can specify a custom distance.

| Command | Example | Status | Notes |

- "move [shape] [direction] [number]" - custom distance without article

**Distance Limits:**
- Minimum: 10 pixels
- Maximum: 500 pixels
- Default: 50 pixels (when no number specified)
- Invalid numbers default to 50 pixels

**Voice Feedback:**
- Default distance: "I moved the square left"
- Custom distance: "I moved the square left 100 pixels"
- No shape: "There's no square on the canvas to move"
- Canvas edge: "I can't move the square any further in that direction"

### Delete Commands
These commands remove the specified shape from the canvas.

| Command | Example | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|

- "remove the [shape]" - with article
- "remove [shape]" - without article

**Voice Feedback:**
- Success: "I deleted the square"
- No shape: "There's no square on the canvas to delete"
