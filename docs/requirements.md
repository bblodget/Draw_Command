# Speech-to-Drawing Demo - Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Recreate the 1980s TI professional computer demo where users can draw and manipulate shapes on screen using voice commands. The system should respond to natural language instructions to create, modify, and arrange graphical elements.

**Status**: ✅ **Feature Complete** - All core requirements have been implemented and the project is deployed at https://bblodget.github.io/Draw_Command/

## Functional Requirements

### Core Voice Commands
The system must recognize and execute the following types of voice commands:

#### Drawing Commands ✅
- ✅ Draw basic shapes (square, circle, triangle)
- ✅ Specify colors for shapes (11 colors supported)
- ✅ Specify sizes for shapes (via resize commands)
- ✅ Specify positions for shapes (spatial relationships)

#### Modification Commands ✅
- ✅ Change color of existing shapes
- ✅ Resize shapes (7 size modifiers: bigger, smaller, much bigger, etc.)
- ✅ Move shapes (4 directions with optional distance)
- ✅ Rotate shapes (default 30° or custom angles)
- ✅ Delete shapes

#### Spatial Relationship Commands ✅
- ✅ Position shapes relative to other shapes
- ✅ 5 spatial relationships with synonyms:
  - "to the left of" / "to the right of"
  - "above" / "over"
  - "below" / "under"
  - "next to" / "beside" / "near"

#### System Commands ✅
- ✅ Clear the entire canvas

### Voice Recognition Requirements ✅
- ✅ Real-time speech-to-text conversion (Web Speech API)
- ✅ Recognition of the word "computer" as attention trigger
- ✅ Recognition of "please" as command execution trigger
- ✅ Support for natural language variations (BNF grammar with synonyms)
- ✅ Handle speech variations (preprocessing for symbols, punctuation)

### Visual Feedback Requirements ✅
- ✅ Display transcribed speech text in real-time
- ✅ Show visual feedback when commands are being processed
- ✅ Indicate when voice recognition is active/listening (color-coded status)
- ✅ Display error messages for unrecognized commands

### Canvas Requirements ✅
- ✅ Interactive drawing canvas (Fabric.js)
- ✅ Support for multiple shapes (Three Object Model: one of each type)
- ✅ Ability to select and manipulate individual shapes
- ✅ Visual representation of shape properties (color, size, position, rotation)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements ✅
- ✅ Voice command response time under 2 seconds (sub-50ms parsing)
- ✅ Smooth canvas rendering and shape manipulation
- ✅ Real-time speech recognition with minimal latency

### Usability Requirements ✅
- ✅ Intuitive voice command interface
- ✅ Clear visual feedback for all user actions
- ✅ Responsive design that works on desktop and tablet
- ✅ Draggable voice control panel

### Reliability Requirements ✅
- ✅ Graceful handling of unrecognized speech
- ✅ Consistent behavior across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari*)
- ✅ State machine architecture for robust command processing

### Security Requirements ✅
- ✅ Client-side only (no server vulnerabilities)
- ✅ HTTPS deployment for microphone access

## User Experience Requirements

### Voice Interaction ✅
- ✅ Natural conversation flow with the system
- ✅ Context awareness (pronoun "it" support with tracking)

### System Response Requirements ✅
- ✅ **Text-to-Speech Output**: System responds using speech synthesis
- ✅ **Visual Text Display**: All commands shown in transcript area
- ✅ **Confirmation Responses**: System confirms actions ("I drew a red square")
- ✅ **Error Responses**: Clear feedback for unrecognized commands
- ✅ **Humor**: Special responses for rotating circles

### Visual Interface ✅
- ✅ Clean, modern interface design (Tailwind CSS)
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy and organization
- ✅ Responsive layout that adapts to screen size
- ✅ Professional appearance suitable for demonstrations

### Learning Curve ✅
- ✅ Intuitive for first-time users
- ✅ Discoverable command patterns
- ✅ Built-in help panel with examples
- ✅ Quick start documentation

## Success Criteria ✅
- ✅ Users can successfully draw and manipulate shapes using only voice commands
- ✅ System responds accurately to natural language instructions
- ✅ Demo can be presented to audiences without technical difficulties
- ✅ Application performs reliably in various environments and conditions
- ✅ Live deployment accessible to anyone: https://bblodget.github.io/Draw_Command/

## Additional Features Implemented

Beyond the original requirements, the project includes:

- **BNF Grammar Architecture**: Sophisticated natural language parsing with Nearley.js
- **Three Object Model**: Simplified interaction with one instance per shape type
- **Advanced Synonyms**: Multiple ways to express the same command
- **Size Relationships**: "Make the triangle the same size as the square"
- **Boundary Protection**: Shapes stay within canvas bounds
- **Collision Detection**: Smart positioning prevents overlapping
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Automatic deployment on every push
- **Zero Server Costs**: 100% client-side implementation
