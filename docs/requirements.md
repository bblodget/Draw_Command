# Speech-to-Drawing Demo - Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Recreate the 1980s TI professional computer demo where users can draw and manipulate shapes on screen using voice commands. The system should respond to natural language instructions to create, modify, and arrange graphical elements.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Voice Commands
The system must recognize and execute the following types of voice commands:

#### Drawing Commands
- Draw basic shapes (square, circle, triangle)
- Specify colors for shapes
- Specify sizes for shapes
- Specify positions for shapes

#### Modification Commands
- Change color of existing shapes
- Resize shapes (bigger, smaller, specific dimensions)
- Move shapes (left, right, up, down, to specific positions)
- Delete shapes

#### Spatial Relationship Commands
- Position shapes relative to other shapes ("to the left of", "above", "next to")

#### System Commands
- Clear the entire canvas

### Voice Recognition Requirements
- Real-time speech-to-text conversion
- Recognition of the word "computer" as attention trigger
- Recognition of "please" as command execution trigger
- Support for natural language variations ("make it bigger" vs "increase size")
- Handle background noise and speech variations

### Visual Feedback Requirements
- Display transcribed speech text in real-time
- Show visual feedback when commands are being processed
- Indicate when voice recognition is active/listening
- Display error messages for unrecognized commands

### Canvas Requirements
- Interactive drawing canvas
- Support for multiple shapes on screen simultaneously
- Ability to select and manipulate individual shapes
- Visual representation of shape properties (color, size, position)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- Voice command response time under 2 seconds
- Smooth canvas rendering and shape manipulation
- Real-time speech recognition with minimal latency

### Usability Requirements
- Intuitive voice command interface
- Clear visual feedback for all user actions
- Responsive design that works on desktop and tablet

### Reliability Requirements
- Graceful handling of unrecognized speech
- Consistent behavior across different browsers

### Security Requirements
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities

## User Experience Requirements

### Voice Interaction
- Natural conversation flow with the system
- Context awareness (referring to "it" or "the square")

### System Response Requirements
- **Text-to-Speech Output**: System responds to questions and informational requests using speech synthesis
- **Visual Text Display**: All system responses also displayed as text on screen for accessibility
- **Confirmation Responses**: System confirms successful actions ("Square drawn successfully", "Color changed to blue")
- **Error Responses**: Clear spoken feedback for unrecognized commands or failed actions

### Visual Interface
- Clean, modern interface design
- Clear visual hierarchy and organization
- Responsive layout that adapts to screen size
- Professional appearance suitable for demonstrations

### Learning Curve
- Intuitive for first-time users
- Discoverable command patterns
- Help system or command suggestions
- Progressive disclosure of advanced features

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully draw and manipulate shapes using only voice commands
- System responds accurately to natural language instructions
- Demo can be presented to audiences without technical difficulties
- Application performs reliably in various environments and conditions
