## 🌐 Live Demo

🚀 **[Try the Live Demo](https://bblodget.github.io/Draw_Command/)**

Full voice-controlled drawing experience with no setup required.

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Getting Started
1. **Grant microphone permissions** when prompted by your browser
2. **Press "Start Voice Recognition"** button in the Voice Control panel
3. **Speak clearly** using the "Computer, [command] please" format

### Three Object Model
The application uses a simplified interaction model with one instance per shape type:
- **One square, one circle, one triangle maximum**
- **Unambiguous shape references** ("the square", "it")
- **Automatic replacement** when creating duplicate types
- **Enhanced spatial relationships** between the three shapes

### Try These Commands:
- **"Computer, draw a red square please"** - Creates a red square
- **"Computer, draw a blue circle to the left of the square please"** - Spatial positioning
- **"Computer, make the square bigger please"** - Resize shapes
- **"Computer, rotate the circle 45 degrees please"** - Custom rotation
- **"Computer, move it to the right please"** - Pronoun references
- **"Computer, make the triangle the same size as the square please"** - Size matching

## ✨ Features

### 🎙️ Advanced Voice Processing
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Sophisticated BNF grammar parser handles complex commands
- **Spatial Relationships**: "Draw a circle to the left of the square"
- **Pronoun Support**: "Move it to the right", "Make it bigger"
- **Size Relationships**: "Make the triangle the same size as the square"
- **Custom Angles**: "Rotate the square 45 degrees"
- **Distance Control**: "Move the circle 150 pixels left"

### 🎨 Drawing Capabilities
- **3 Shape Types**: Squares, circles, triangles
- **12+ Colors**: Red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, brown, black, white, gray, cyan
- **Shape Operations**: Draw, move, delete, resize, rotate, color change
- **Collision Detection**: Smart positioning prevents overlapping
- **Canvas Boundaries**: Shapes stay within visible area

### 🖥️ User Interface
- **Draggable Voice Control**: Move the control panel anywhere
- **Real-time Transcript**: See your commands as you speak
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded status indicators
- **Always-visible UI**: Optimized for demos and presentations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet

### 🧠 Intelligence Features
- **Context Awareness**: Understands "it", "the red square", etc.
- **Command Variations**: "Draw" vs "Create", "Delete" vs "Remove"
- **Filler Word Handling**: Natural speech patterns supported
- **Error Recovery**: Helpful feedback for unrecognized commands
- **Circle Humor**: Fun responses for rotating circles

## 📊 Project Status

**✅ Feature Complete and Deployed**

Live demo available at https://bblodget.github.io/Draw_Command/

### Project Features

**BNF Grammar Architecture**: Grammar-based parsing system supporting:
- Complex spatial relationships
- Pronoun resolution  
- Natural language variations
- Sub-50ms parsing performance

**Advanced Commands**:
- 5 spatial relationships (left of, right of, above, below, next to)

- Custom rotation angles with negative support
- Visual size conversion between shape types

**Production Deployment**: Live demo with zero server costs, automatic CI/CD, and HTTPS microphone access.

## 🔄 How it Works

The application uses a simple but powerful voice recognition flow:

1. **Wake Word**: Say "Computer" to start a command
2. **Speech Recognition**: The Web Speech API converts your speech to text
3. **Grammar Parsing**: A BNF grammar parser understands the command structure
4. **Canvas Operation**: The command is executed on the HTML5 canvas
5. **Voice Response**: The system confirms the action with speech synthesis
6. **Ready for Next**: Say "Computer" again to start a new command

All processing happens in your browser - no server required!

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: [React 18](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Voice**: [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) (recognition + synthesis)
- **Parsing**: BNF Grammar with [Nearley.js](https://nearley.js.org/) (replaced regex)
- **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas + [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/)
- **Deployment**: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) CI/CD
- **Architecture**: 100% client-side, no backend required

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

Uses [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) which may not be supported in all browsers. Most testing done in Chrome.

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### BNF Grammar System
The project uses a sophisticated grammar-based parser instead of simple regex matching:

- **8-Phase Grammar Implementation**: Incremental development from basic shapes to advanced features
- **Nearley.js Integration**: Production-ready parser with TypeScript support  
- **Natural Language Support**: Handles filler words, variations, and complex syntax
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new commands and features

### Collision Detection & Smart Positioning
- **Random Position Generation**: New shapes placed at non-overlapping locations
- **Boundary Protection**: All shapes stay within canvas bounds
- **Spatial Relationship Accuracy**: Precise positioning relative to reference shapes
- **User Position Preservation**: Manual positioning maintained during operations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Basic Usage
- Make sure you press the **"Start Voice Recognition"** button
- Start every command with **"Computer"**
- End every command with **"please"** 
- You can start a command over again by saying **"Computer"**
- Check that you see the transcript adding words as you talk

### Microphone Permissions

**Chrome Browser Settings:**
1. Click the **lock icon** (left of the URL bar) → **Site settings**
2. Set **Microphone = Allow** (Camera can stay Ask/Block; only mic needed)
3. If previously blocked, use **Reset permissions** then reload and **Allow** when prompted

**macOS System Settings:**
1. Go **Apple menu** > **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Microphone**
2. Ensure **Google Chrome** (and/or "Chrome") is toggled **on**
3. If it was off, toggle on and **restart Chrome**

### Browser Compatibility
Uses [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) which may not be supported in all browsers (see browser compatibility above). Most testing done in Chrome browser.
