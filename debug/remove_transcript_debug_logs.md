 Debug Logs Identified

  I've found 10 debug console.log statements that were added during Task 1.77. Here's the complete mapping:

  Debug Logs Added in Task 1.77:

  1. Lines 83-85: Speech recognition result logging
  console.log('Speech recognition result:');
  console.log('  - finalTranscript:', finalTranscript);
  console.log('  - interimTranscript:', interimTranscript);
  2. Line 116: Processing final transcript
  console.log('Processing final transcript:', finalTranscript);
  3. Line 120: Reset accumulation
  console.log('Reset accumulation to:', this.accumulatedTranscript);
  4. Line 128: Updated accumulation
  console.log('Updated accumulation to:', this.accumulatedTranscript);
  5. Line 152: Execute word detected
  console.log('Execute word detected in display transcript:', displayTranscript);
  6. Line 157: Extracted command
  console.log('Extracted command:', command);
  7. Line 162: Executing command (KEEP - Essential)
  console.log('Executing command:', command);
  8. Line 167: Duplicate command ignored (KEEP - Essential)
  console.log('Duplicate command ignored:', command);
  9. Line 175: Transcript state cleared
  console.log('Transcript state cleared after command execution');
  10. Lines 186-188: Processing final transcript details
  console.log('Processing final transcript:', transcript);
  console.log('Current attentionWordDetected:', this.attentionWordDetected);
  console.log('Current accumulatedTranscript:', this.accumulatedTranscript);
  11. Line 193: Attention word detected
  console.log('Attention word detected, resetting accumulation');

  Essential Logs to Keep:

  - Line 162: console.log('Executing command:', command); - Important for debugging command execution
  - Line 167: console.log('Duplicate command ignored:', command); - Important for understanding duplicate prevention
  - Line 237: console.error('Microphone permission denied:', error); - Error logging (already existed)

  Analysis of Timing Impact:

  The debug logs are distributed across critical timing points:
  - Speech recognition processing (lines 83-85)
  - Transcript accumulation (lines 116, 120, 128)
  - Command execution flow (lines 152, 157, 175)
  - State management (lines 186-188, 193)

  These logs may be providing crucial timing delays that prevent:
  1. The system from hearing its own voice responses
  2. Race conditions in transcript accumulation
  3. Rapid state changes that could cause instability

  Next Step: Before removing any logs, we should test the current system behavior to establish a baseline. This will help us understand exactly what issues arise when
   the logs are removed.
