### Problems Encountered and Solutions

**Problem**: Initial session updates used estimated timestamps instead of actual time
**Solution**: Updated workflow documentation and session-update command to use `date` command for accurate timestamps

**Problem**: Some documentation had outdated information (12+ colors vs 11 actual colors)
**Solution**: Systematically reviewed all technical details for accuracy

**Problem**: Inconsistent project naming (Speech-to-Drawing Demo vs Draw Command)
**Solution**: Standardized on "Draw Command" throughout all documentation

### Breaking Changes

None - this was a documentation-only update with no code changes.

### Dependencies

No dependencies added or removed.

### Configuration Changes

Updated `.claude/commands/session-update.md` to include date command usage instructions.

### Deployment Steps

No deployment steps required - documentation updates will be deployed automatically via GitHub Pages after merge.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Always use `date` command** for accurate timestamps in session management
2. **Systematic review approach** works well for comprehensive documentation updates
3. **Consistency checking** is crucial when updating multiple related documents
4. **User-focused organization** makes documentation more accessible

### What Wasn't Completed

All planned tasks were completed successfully. No outstanding items remain.

### Tips for Future Developers

1. **Use the `date` command** for all session timestamps
2. **Review related documents** when updating any single doc to maintain consistency
3. **Test all links and references** when updating documentation
4. **Focus on user experience** - organize docs for easy navigation and understanding
5. **Keep technical details accurate** - verify implementation details when documenting

### üéâ TASK 3.2 COMPLETE

**Task 3.2: Documentation Cleanup and Final Review** has been successfully completed. All project documentation is now current, accurate, comprehensive, and ready for the final project completion.
