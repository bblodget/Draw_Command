## Session Overview
**Start Time**: 2025-01-07 15:26  
**Session Type**: Development - Task Implementation  
**Branch**: `feature-task-1-76-move-and-delete-commands`  

## Goals
- Implement moveShape method in CanvasService for directional movement
- Implement deleteShape method in CanvasService for shape removal  
- Update App.tsx to execute move commands instead of showing placeholder
- Update App.tsx to execute delete commands instead of showing placeholder
- Add appropriate voice responses for successful moves and deletions
- Handle edge cases (moving off canvas, deleting non-existent shapes)
- Test all four directions and delete functionality
- Update voice commands documentation

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Implementation

- [ ] Test delete commands for all shape types
- [ ] Test error cases (deleting non-existent shapes, invalid moves)
- [ ] Test voice responses are appropriate
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

### Phase 3: Commit Ready

## Progress Updates

### Update - 2025-01-07 3:35 PM

**Workflow Phase:** âœ… Implementation Complete  
**Feature Branch:** feature-task-1-76-move-and-delete-commands  
**Status:** All tasks completed, ready for testing and user approval  

**Summary**: Successfully implemented move and delete voice commands with full functionality

**Implementation Details**:
1. **CanvasService Methods**:
   - `moveShapeByType()`: Moves shapes by directional offset with canvas boundary checking
   - `deleteShapeByType()`: Removes shapes and cleans up all tracking

2. **App.tsx Updates**:
   - Move commands now execute with proper direction detection
   - Delete commands remove shapes with appropriate feedback
   - Error handling for non-existent shapes and canvas boundaries

3. **Voice Responses**:
   - Success: "I moved the square left" / "I deleted the circle"
   - No shape: "There's no square on the canvas to move/delete"
   - Boundary: "I can't move the square any further in that direction"

4. **Documentation**:
   - Updated voice commands doc to show full support status
   - Added voice feedback examples
   - Removed "Partially Supported" section (now empty)
   - Updated testing commands and development phases

**Testing Status**: Ready for user testing
**Next Step**: User approval before committing changes
