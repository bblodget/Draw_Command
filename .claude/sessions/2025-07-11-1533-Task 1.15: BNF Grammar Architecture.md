# Session: Task 1.15: BNF Grammar Architecture
**Started**: 2025-07-11 15:33

## Session Overview
**Goal**: Replace regex-based parsing with grammar-based parsing to support complex natural language commands and spatial relationships.

**Start Time**: 2025-07-11 15:33
**Feature Branch**: `feature-bnf-grammar-architecture`
**Base Branch**: `main`

## Goals
**Primary Goal**: Implement BNF grammar architecture to replace current regex-based command parsing

**Specific Objectives**:
- Research and select appropriate parsing library (Nearley.js, PEG.js, ANTLR, or Chevrotain)
- Design BNF grammar for voice commands based on universal template from docs/command_syntax.md
- Implement grammar-based parser to replace CommandService regex patterns
- Add support for spatial relationship commands ("to the left of", "above", "below")
- Add support for complex size relationships ("same size as", "twice as big as")
- Implement pronoun reference resolution within grammar
- Fix the critical "make" command bug discovered in Task 1.12
- Ensure all existing commands continue to work without regression

**Background Context**:
During Task 1.12 session, we discovered that regex patterns have fundamental limitations for natural language processing. The current regex approach suffers from pattern matching conflicts (e.g., the "make" command bug where "Computer, make the square bigger please" changes color to black instead of resizing).

## Development Workflow
**Branch Management**:
- ✅ Created feature branch: `feature-bnf-grammar-architecture`
- ✅ Base branch: `main` (clean working tree)
- 📋 Changes will remain uncommitted until testing is complete
- 📋 Will follow: implement → test → commit → merge workflow

**Session Tracking**:
- Session file: `2025-07-11-1533-Task 1.15: BNF Grammar Architecture.md`
- Current session: Active
- Updates: Use `/project:session-update` to track progress
- Completion: Use `/project:session-end` to finalize

### Update - 2025-07-11 10:28 PM

**Workflow Phase:** Commit Ready  
**Feature Branch:** feature-bnf-grammar-architecture  
**Status:** Grammar refactoring complete, ready to commit

**Summary**: Implemented elegant grammar refactoring for cleaner, more semantic structure

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: docs/grammar.md, src/grammar/voice-commands.js, src/grammar/voice-commands.ne
- Current branch: feature-bnf-grammar-architecture (commit: 099df53)
- **Workflow Status:** ✅ Changes ready to commit

**Todo Progress**: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 4 pending
- ✓ Completed: Refactor grammar with semantic object phrase separation
- 📋 Pending: Add delete command - Phase 4, Step 4.1

**Technical Achievements**:
- **Semantic Refactoring**: Split `<object-phrase>` into `<draw-object-phrase>` and `<move-object-phrase>`
- **Color Restriction**: Removed color from move commands (aligns with three-object model)
- **Optional Fillers**: Implemented `<fillers>?` pattern using Nearley's `optional_fillers` rule
- **Cleaner Structure**: Single pattern for move commands instead of redundant alternatives

**User-Driven Improvements**:
1. **Semantic clarity**: "draw" and "move" commands now have distinct structures
2. **Three-object model**: Move commands don't allow color (only one square exists)
3. **Elegant patterns**: `<fillers>? <direction>` replaces two separate patterns

**Grammar Evolution**:
```bnf
<object-phrase> ::= <draw-object-phrase>
                  | <move-object-phrase>

<draw-object-phrase> ::= <fillers> <shape>
                       | <fillers> <color> <shape>

<move-object-phrase> ::= <fillers> <shape> <fillers>? <direction>
```

**Testing Status**: All existing commands continue to work with improved structure
**Next Steps**: Ready to proceed with Phase 4 - Add delete command functionality

- 📋 Pending: Add delete command - Phase 4, Step 4.1

**Technical Achievements**:
- **Number Grammar**: Added regex pattern `[1-9][0-9]*` for integer parsing
- **Unit Support**: Added "pixels" and "px" unit options
- **Three Patterns**: `<direction>`, `<direction> <number>`, `<direction> <number> <unit>`
- **TypeScript Integration**: Added `distance?: number` and `unit?: string` to ObjectPhrase
- **Service Layer**: Updated move command handling to extract and use parsed distance/unit

**User Feedback Integration**:
- **Default Distance**: Changed from 50 to 100 pixels as requested
- **No Clamping**: Removed distance limits, relying on canvas bounds checking

- **Parsing Fix**: Parser now correctly distinguishes between command types

**New Grammar Structure**:
```bnf
<command> ::= <clear>
            | <draw> <draw-object-phrase>
            | <move> <move-object-phrase>
            | <delete> <delete-object-phrase>
```

**Supported Delete Commands**:
✅ `computer delete the square please`

### Update - 2025-07-12 11:10 AM

**Workflow Phase:** Implementation 🔧
**Feature Branch:** feature-bnf-grammar-architecture
**Status:** Additional improvements implemented, uncommitted changes

**Summary**: Fixed default color response mismatch - voice responses now accurately reflect actual shape colors when no color is specified in commands.

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: src/App.tsx, src/services/canvas.service.ts
- Added: screenshots/shot020.png, screenshots/shot021.png
- Current branch: feature-bnf-grammar-architecture (commit: 63af54f)
- **Workflow Status:** ✅ Changes ready for testing and commit

**Todo Progress**: 12 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending ✅
- All original BNF Grammar Architecture tasks remain completed
- Additional improvement: Fixed default color response accuracy

**Issue Resolved**: Default Color Response Mismatch
- **Problem**: When no color specified, voice always said "red" regardless of actual shape color
  - "Computer draw a square please" → made red square, said "red square" ✅
  - "Computer draw a triangle please" → made green triangle, said "red triangle" ❌  
  - "Computer draw a circle please" → made blue circle, said "red circle" ❌

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced canvas service**: Added `actualColor` field to draw method return values
2. **Updated response logic**: Use actual color from canvas service instead of fallback
3. **Accurate messaging**: Voice responses now match the actual drawn color

**Code Changes**:
- **Canvas Service**: Modified `drawSquare()`, `drawCircle()`, `drawTriangle()` to return `actualColor`
- **App.tsx**: Updated response generation to use `result.actualColor` instead of `shapeColor || '#FF0000'`

**Testing Status**: Ready for user testing of accurate color responses
**Expected Results**: 
- "Computer draw a square please" → "I drew a red square" ✅
- "Computer draw a triangle please" → "I drew a green triangle" ✅  
- "Computer draw a circle please" → "I drew a blue circle" ✅
