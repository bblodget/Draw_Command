# Session: Task 1.15: BNF Grammar Architecture
**Started**: 2025-07-11 15:33

## Session Overview
**Goal**: Replace regex-based parsing with grammar-based parsing to support complex natural language commands and spatial relationships.

**Start Time**: 2025-07-11 15:33
**Feature Branch**: `feature-bnf-grammar-architecture`
**Base Branch**: `main`

## Goals
**Primary Goal**: Implement BNF grammar architecture to replace current regex-based command parsing

**Specific Objectives**:
- Research and select appropriate parsing library (Nearley.js, PEG.js, ANTLR, or Chevrotain)
- Design BNF grammar for voice commands based on universal template from docs/command_syntax.md
- Implement grammar-based parser to replace CommandService regex patterns
- Add support for spatial relationship commands ("to the left of", "above", "below")
- Add support for complex size relationships ("same size as", "twice as big as")
- Implement pronoun reference resolution within grammar
- Fix the critical "make" command bug discovered in Task 1.12
- Ensure all existing commands continue to work without regression

**Background Context**:
During Task 1.12 session, we discovered that regex patterns have fundamental limitations for natural language processing. The current regex approach suffers from pattern matching conflicts (e.g., the "make" command bug where "Computer, make the square bigger please" changes color to black instead of resizing).

## Development Workflow
**Branch Management**:
- ✅ Created feature branch: `feature-bnf-grammar-architecture`
- ✅ Base branch: `main` (clean working tree)
- 📋 Changes will remain uncommitted until testing is complete
- 📋 Will follow: implement → test → commit → merge workflow

**Session Tracking**:
- Session file: `2025-07-11-1533-Task 1.15: BNF Grammar Architecture.md`
- Current session: Active
- Updates: Use `/project:session-update` to track progress

### Update - 2025-07-11 9:50 PM

**Workflow Phase:** Testing  
**Feature Branch:** feature-bnf-grammar-architecture  
**Status:** Direction extraction bug fixed, awaiting final testing

**Summary**: Fixed critical direction extraction bug in grammar postprocessing function

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: docs/grammar.md, src/grammar/voice-commands.js, src/grammar/voice-commands.ne, src/services/grammar-command.service.ts, src/types/grammar.ts
- Current branch: feature-bnf-grammar-architecture (commit: 092fed6)
- **Workflow Status:** ✅ Bug fix ready for testing

**Todo Progress**: 6 completed, 1 in progress, 5 pending
- ✓ Completed: Add move command with directions - Phase 3, Step 3.1
- 🔄 In Progress: Debug direction extraction issue

**Testing Status**: 🐛 **Critical Bug Fixed** - Direction extraction now working
**Issue**: Command "computer move the square to the right please" was parsing successfully but direction was null
**Root Cause**: Recursive `<fillers>` rule caused incorrect array indexing in postprocessing function
**Solution**: Fixed array index from `d[4]` to `d[6]` in `fillers _ shape _ fillers _ direction` pattern

**Technical Resolution**:
- **Array Structure**: "to the" creates sequence: fillers(to) + _ + shape + _ + fillers(the) + _ + direction
- **Correct Indexing**: d[0]=fillers, d[1]=_, d[2]=shape, d[3]=_, d[4]=fillers, d[5]=_, d[6]=direction
- **Grammar Fix**: Updated postprocessing function to extract direction from correct position
- **Module Export**: Re-added ES module export after grammar recompilation

**Commands Ready for Testing**:
- "computer move the square to the right please"
- "computer move the square left please"
- "computer move the circle up please"
- "computer move the triangle down please"

**Next Steps**: User testing of movement commands with corrected direction extraction

### Update - 2025-07-11 10:28 PM

**Workflow Phase:** Commit Ready  
**Feature Branch:** feature-bnf-grammar-architecture  
**Status:** Grammar refactoring complete, ready to commit

**Summary**: Implemented elegant grammar refactoring for cleaner, more semantic structure

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: docs/grammar.md, src/grammar/voice-commands.js, src/grammar/voice-commands.ne
- Current branch: feature-bnf-grammar-architecture (commit: 099df53)
- **Workflow Status:** ✅ Changes ready to commit

**Todo Progress**: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 4 pending
- ✓ Completed: Refactor grammar with semantic object phrase separation
- 📋 Pending: Add delete command - Phase 4, Step 4.1

**Technical Achievements**:
- **Semantic Refactoring**: Split `<object-phrase>` into `<draw-object-phrase>` and `<move-object-phrase>`
- **Color Restriction**: Removed color from move commands (aligns with three-object model)
- **Optional Fillers**: Implemented `<fillers>?` pattern using Nearley's `optional_fillers` rule
- **Cleaner Structure**: Single pattern for move commands instead of redundant alternatives

**User-Driven Improvements**:
1. **Semantic clarity**: "draw" and "move" commands now have distinct structures
2. **Three-object model**: Move commands don't allow color (only one square exists)
3. **Elegant patterns**: `<fillers>? <direction>` replaces two separate patterns

**Grammar Evolution**:
```bnf
<object-phrase> ::= <draw-object-phrase>
                  | <move-object-phrase>

<draw-object-phrase> ::= <fillers> <shape>
                       | <fillers> <color> <shape>

<move-object-phrase> ::= <fillers> <shape> <fillers>? <direction>
```

**Testing Status**: All existing commands continue to work with improved structure
**Next Steps**: Ready to proceed with Phase 4 - Add delete command functionality
