## Progress Tracking

### Testing Results
**Major Success**: ✅ Duplicate command execution bug fixed!

**Test Results**:
- ✅ All Quick Start guide commands executed flawlessly
- ✅ No duplicate command execution observed
- ✅ State machine transitions working correctly
- ✅ Speech recognition restart after each command successful

### Issues Found
1. **Duplicate Command Execution** (✅ RESOLVED)
   - **Symptoms**: After executing a command correctly, saying a new command sometimes executes the previous command instead
   - **Root Cause**: Speech recognition accumulates results across commands in continuous mode
   - **Solution Implemented**: 
     - Added enhanced debug logging to trace command flow
     - Clear stateTranscript after command execution 
     - Restart speech recognition after each command to clear accumulated results
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Tested successfully with all Quick Start commands!

2. **Rotated Shape Positioning Issue** (✅ RESOLVED)
   - **Symptoms**: When rotating a shape then doing relative placement, shapes don't align properly
   - **Root Cause**: Positioning logic used top-left corner coordinates, which change when shapes are rotated
   - **Solution Implemented**: 
     - Updated `getShapeBounds()` to use actual center position from Fabric.js objects
     - Changed `calculateSpatialPosition()` to use center-based positioning logic
     - Added `isCenterPositionOnCanvas()` method for proper bounds checking
     - Convert center coordinates to top-left for Fabric.js compatibility
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED - WORKING PERFECTLY! Rotated shapes now align correctly with center-based positioning

### Tips for Future Developers

#### **Debugging Voice Commands**
1. **Use prefixed console logs**: `[STATE MACHINE]`, `[POSITIONING]` for easy filtering
2. **Test rotation scenarios**: Always test spatial relationships after shape rotation
3. **Check coordinate systems**: Verify center vs top-left coordinate consistency
4. **Monitor speech recognition**: Watch for command accumulation across sessions

#### **Spatial Positioning**
1. **Always use getCenterPoint()**: For rotated shapes, never rely on left/top coordinates
2. **Coordinate conversion**: Be explicit about center ↔ top-left conversions
3. **Real-time positions**: Use actual Fabric positions, not stored positions for calculations
4. **Debug logging**: Log all coordinate calculations for troubleshooting

#### **State Machine Maintenance**
1. **Session management**: Ensure proper speech recognition session isolation
2. **Event-driven design**: Avoid recursive state transitions
3. **Comprehensive logging**: Essential for debugging complex state transitions
4. **Testing patterns**: Test command sequences, not just individual commands

### Future Development Priorities
1. **Remove debug console logs** for production readiness
2. **Comprehensive feature testing** across all command types
3. **Performance optimization** if needed after full testing
4. **Additional polish items** as discovered during extended testing
