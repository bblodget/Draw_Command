### Primary Objectives
1. **Comprehensive Testing** - Test all voice commands across different browsers and devices
2. **User Experience Polish** - Ensure smooth, professional demo experience
3. **Bug Verification** - Confirm all Phase 2 fixes are working correctly
4. **Documentation Review** - Ensure README and demo instructions are accurate
5. **Performance Optimization** - Verify responsive performance across all features
6. **Demo Preparation** - Create checklist for live demonstrations

### Testing Checklist

## Development Workflow
- **Feature Branch**: `feature-task-2-5-final-testing-polish`
- **Working Directory**: Clean state, ready for testing and polish
- **Workflow**: Test → Document Issues → Fix → Re-test → Commit → Session Update → Merge
- **Target**: Production-ready demo with zero critical issues

## Progress Tracking

### Testing Results
**Major Success**: ✅ Duplicate command execution bug fixed!

**Test Results**:
- ✅ All Quick Start guide commands executed flawlessly
- ✅ No duplicate command execution observed
- ✅ State machine transitions working correctly
- ✅ Speech recognition restart after each command successful

### Issues Found
1. **Duplicate Command Execution** (✅ RESOLVED)
   - **Symptoms**: After executing a command correctly, saying a new command sometimes executes the previous command instead
   - **Root Cause**: Speech recognition accumulates results across commands in continuous mode
   - **Solution Implemented**: 
     - Added enhanced debug logging to trace command flow
     - Clear stateTranscript after command execution 
     - Restart speech recognition after each command to clear accumulated results
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Tested successfully with all Quick Start commands!

### Polish Items
*To be identified during testing*

### Documentation Updates
