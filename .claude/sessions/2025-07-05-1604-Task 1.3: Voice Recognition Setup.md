- Current status: Active development
- Commits: 0

## Progress

### Update - 2025-07-05 16:04 PM
**Phase:** Session Started
**Status:** Ready to begin implementation

Session initialized for Task 1.3: Voice Recognition Setup. Feature branch created and ready for development.

### Update - 2025-07-05 17:15 PM

**Workflow Phase:** Commit Ready
**Feature Branch:** feature-task-1-3-voice-recognition-setup
**Status:** Changes tested and approved, ready to commit

**Summary**: Successfully implemented comprehensive voice recognition system with Web Speech API

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: src/App.tsx, src/components/VoiceInterface/index.tsx, src/services/voice.service.ts
- Current branch: feature-task-1-3-voice-recognition-setup (commit: bd7369d)
- **Workflow Status:** ✅ Changes tested, user approved, ready to commit

**Todo Progress**: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 11 pending
- ✓ Completed: Enhance VoiceService with Web Speech API implementation (includes tasks 1-4)

**Testing Status**: User confirmed voice recognition works correctly with proper attention word detection
**Issues Encountered**: 
1. Initial import syntax error with interface export
2. Logic issue with command vs transcript callbacks - both were triggering command detection
**Solutions Implemented**: 
1. Fixed import to use separate type import for VoiceRecognitionCallbacks
2. Separated onTranscript and onCommand callbacks to properly distinguish between transcript display and command execution
**Code Changes**:
- Complete VoiceService rewrite with Web Speech API integration
- Added continuous listening, interim results, attention word detection
- Implemented command extraction between "Computer" and "please"
- Built comprehensive VoiceInterface component with full UI
- Added microphone permission handling and error management
- Connected voice system to App component for command flow
**Details**: Voice recognition now properly detects "Computer" attention word, extracts clean commands, and provides real-time transcript feedback

**Workflow Compliance:** ✅ Followed feature branch workflow correctly

### Todo Summary
**Total Tasks:** 12  
**Completed:** 9  
**Remaining:** 3 (all low priority)  

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Enhance VoiceService with Web Speech API implementation
- ✅ Add microphone permission handling
- ✅ Implement attention word detection ("Computer")
- ✅ Add command execution word detection ("please")
- ✅ Update VoiceInterface component with controls
- ✅ Add visual feedback for voice recognition status
- ✅ Display real-time speech transcription
- ✅ Implement speech recognition error handling
- ✅ Add voice recognition start/stop controls

**Incomplete Tasks:**
- ⏭️ Test voice recognition in multiple browsers (manual task - low priority)
- ⏭️ Connect voice interface to canvas for testing (for next phase)
- ⏭️ Add voice response feedback system (enhancement - low priority)

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Complete Voice Recognition System:** Implemented full Web Speech API integration with continuous listening
2. **Attention Word Detection:** Successfully detects "Computer" to activate listening mode
3. **Command Extraction:** Properly extracts commands between "Computer" and "please" keywords
4. **Professional UI:** Built comprehensive VoiceInterface component with controls and feedback
5. **Error Handling:** Robust microphone permission and speech recognition error management
6. **Real-time Feedback:** Live transcript display and status indicators

### Features Implemented
- **Continuous Speech Recognition:** Using Web Speech API with interim and final results
- **Attention Word System:** "Computer" activates, "please" executes commands
- **Command Extraction Logic:** Clean command parsing between trigger words
- **Microphone Permission Management:** Automatic permission requests and error handling
- **Visual Status Indicators:** Real-time listening status and speech detection feedback
- **Comprehensive UI Controls:** Start/stop buttons, transcript display, test speech functionality
- **Error Management:** Browser compatibility warnings and graceful error handling
- **App Integration:** Connected voice commands to main application flow

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
1. **Interface Export Issue:**
   - Problem: VoiceRecognitionCallbacks interface not properly exported
   - Solution: Fixed import syntax with separate type import

2. **Command Detection Logic:**
   - Problem: Both transcript and commands were triggering command callbacks
   - Solution: Separated onTranscript and onCommand callbacks for proper distinction

### Dependencies Added
- No new dependencies (used built-in Web Speech API)

### Configuration Changes
- No configuration changes required

### Lessons Learned
1. Web Speech API requires careful handling of continuous listening and auto-restart
2. Callback separation is crucial for distinguishing between transcript display and command execution
3. Microphone permissions must be handled gracefully with user feedback
4. Browser compatibility varies significantly for speech recognition features

### What Wasn't Completed
- Multi-browser testing (manual task for user)
- Voice response feedback system (enhancement for future)
- Canvas integration (will be part of command parsing phase)

### Tips for Future Developers
1. Web Speech API works best in Chrome, has limitations in other browsers
2. The attention word system prevents accidental command execution
3. Command extraction logic is flexible and can be extended for more complex patterns
4. VoiceService callbacks are designed for easy integration with React components
5. Error handling includes both permission and recognition errors
6. The system is ready for command parsing integration in next phase

### Next Steps
- Ready for Task 1.4: Command Parsing (regex-based)
- Voice recognition foundation is solid for voice-controlled drawing
- Consider adding more sophisticated command patterns as needed
