# Task 1.10 (Rotate Commands) - Development Session

**Session Start**: 2025-07-12 3:40 PM

## Session Overview

Starting development session to implement Task 1.10: Rotate Commands. This will add shape rotation functionality with default and custom angles to the voice-controlled drawing system.

## Goals

**Primary Goal**: Implement shape rotation with voice commands
- Add support for basic rotation commands ("rotate the triangle")
- Add support for custom angles ("rotate the triangle 45 degrees")
- Support negative angles for counter-clockwise rotation
- Implement rotateShape method in CanvasService
- Update App.tsx to handle rotate commands
- Add appropriate voice responses

**Secondary Goals**:
- Test rotation with all shape types (square, circle, triangle)
- Ensure rotation maintains shape position
- Add rotation to BNF grammar for proper command parsing
- Update voice commands documentation
- Verify no regression in existing functionality

## Technical Context

**Task Requirements** (from plan.md):
- Create regex pattern for "rotate the [shape]" commands
- Add support for custom angles "rotate the [shape] 45 degrees"
- Support negative angles "rotate the [shape] negative 45 degrees"
- Implement rotateShape method in CanvasService
- Update App.tsx to handle rotate commands
- Add appropriate voice responses
- Test various rotation angles
- Update voice commands documentation

**Expected Behavior**:
- "Rotate the triangle" rotates 90 degrees clockwise
- "Rotate the triangle 45 degrees" rotates exactly 45 degrees
- "Rotate the triangle negative 45 degrees" rotates counter-clockwise
- Rotation maintains shape position
- Voice confirms: "I rotated the triangle 45 degrees"

**Key Files to Modify**:
- `src/grammar/voice-commands.ne` - BNF grammar for rotation commands
- `src/services/canvas.service.ts` - rotateShape method implementation
- `src/App.tsx` - Command handling integration
- `src/types/index.ts` - Command type definitions if needed

## Session Notes

### Planning Phase ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Duration**: ~15 minutes

**Current Implementation Status Analysis**:

‚úÖ **Grammar Command Service**: `handleRotateCommand` method already exists and is well-implemented
- Supports shape/pronoun identification  
- Handles angle parsing with 90¬∞ default
- Returns properly formatted DrawCommand

‚ùå **BNF Grammar**: No rotation support in voice-commands.ne
- Need to add rotation verb and object phrases
- Need to support basic rotation, custom angles, and negative angles
- Test case exists but probably fails without grammar support

‚ùå **App.tsx**: No rotation case handling 
- Need to add `case 'rotate'` in command processing
- Need voice response for rotation confirmations

‚ùå **CanvasService**: No `rotateShape` method
- Need to implement rotation using Fabric.js capabilities
- Must maintain shape position during rotation
- Support for positive/negative angles

**Design Decisions**:

**Rotation Method Signature**:
```typescript
rotateShapeByType(shapeType: string, angle: number): boolean
```

**Grammar Structure Needed**:
```bnf
<rotate-object-phrase> ::= <pronoun-or-shape>                    // default 90¬∞
                        | <pronoun-or-shape> <fillers>? <number> // custom angle  
                        | <pronoun-or-shape> <fillers>? <number> "degrees"
                        | <pronoun-or-shape> <fillers>? "negative" <number>
                        | <pronoun-or-shape> <fillers>? "negative" <number> "degrees"
```

**Voice Responses**:
- Default: "I rotated the triangle 90 degrees"
- Custom: "I rotated the triangle 45 degrees" 
- Negative: "I rotated the triangle negative 30 degrees"

**Implementation Plan Identified**:
1. Update BNF grammar to add rotation commands
2. Implement `rotateShapeByType` in CanvasService  
3. Add rotation case handling in App.tsx
4. Test all rotation scenarios

### Update - 2025-07-12 3:57 PM

**Workflow Phase:** Planning & Design
**Feature Branch:** feature-task-1-10-rotate-commands
**Status:** Planning phase completed, ready for grammar updates

**Summary**: Completed comprehensive planning phase for Task 1.10 rotation commands. Analyzed existing codebase and identified implementation requirements. Found that `handleRotateCommand` already exists in grammar-command.service.ts with proper angle parsing and 90¬∞ default. Ready to proceed with collaborative grammar.md updates as requested by user.

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: .claude/sessions/.current-session
- Added: .claude/sessions/2025-07-12-1540-Task 1.10 (Rotate Commands).md
- Current branch: feature-task-1-10-rotate-commands (commit: 61b5335)
- **Workflow Status:** ‚úÖ Clean working directory, planning phase complete

**Todo Progress**: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ‚úì Completed: Review existing task requirements from plan.md
- ‚úì Completed: Analyze current command structure for integration  
- ‚úì Completed: Design rotation method signature and behavior
- ‚úì Completed: Plan grammar updates for rotation commands

**Planning Results**:
- **Grammar Command Service**: ‚úÖ `handleRotateCommand` already implemented with proper angle parsing
- **BNF Grammar**: ‚ùå No rotation support in voice-commands.ne - needs implementation
- **App.tsx**: ‚ùå No rotation case handling - needs `case 'rotate'` 
- **CanvasService**: ‚ùå No `rotateShapeByType` method - needs Fabric.js rotation implementation

**Next Steps**: User requested collaborative update to docs/grammar.md before coding begins

### Update - 2025-07-13 12:20 AM

**Workflow Phase:** Testing
**Feature Branch:** feature-task-1-10-rotate-commands
**Status:** Implementation completed, debugging angle extraction issue

**Summary**: Successfully implemented complete rotation command functionality with 30¬∞ default, custom angles, negative rotation, pronoun support, and circle humor. Fixed critical angle extraction bug where grammar was storing angle in `object.angle` but command service was looking for it in `value.number`.

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: docs/grammar.md, src/App.tsx, src/grammar/voice-commands.js, src/grammar/voice-commands.ne, src/services/canvas.service.ts, src/services/grammar-command.service.ts, src/types/grammar.ts, src/types/index.ts
- Added: .claude/sessions/2025-07-12-1540-Task 1.10 (Rotate Commands).md
- Current branch: feature-task-1-10-rotate-commands (commit: 61b5335)
- **Workflow Status:** ‚úÖ Implementation complete, ready for user testing

**Todo Progress**: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 1 pending
- ‚úì Completed: Update Nearley grammar (voice-commands.ne) to add rotation command support
- ‚úì Completed: Add rotation property to shape objects and preserve it during move/resize/color operations
- ‚úì Completed: Implement rotateShapeByType method in CanvasService with circle humor
- ‚úì Completed: Add rotation case handling in App.tsx with voice responses
- ‚è≥ Pending: Test rotation commands with all shapes and edge cases

**Issues Encountered**:
1. Default angle mismatch: Grammar service using 90¬∞ instead of 30¬∞ default
2. Angle extraction bug: Grammar stored angle in `object.angle` but service looked for `value.number`

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Updated `handleRotateCommand` default from 90¬∞ to 30¬∞ for demo visibility
2. Modified `convertToDrawCommand` to extract `angle` from object and pass to handler
3. Updated `ObjectPhrase` interface to include `angle?: number` property
4. Added comprehensive debug logging to track angle parsing flow

**Code Changes Made**:
- **Grammar**: Added rotation verb, object phrases with optional angles and signs
- **Types**: Added rotation property to Shape interface and angle to ObjectPhrase
- **Canvas Service**: Implemented `rotateShapeByType` with circle humor and rotation preservation
- **App.tsx**: Added rotation command case with proper angle handling and voice responses
- **Command Service**: Fixed angle extraction and updated method signatures

**Testing Status**: Ready for user testing of rotation commands including default (30¬∞), custom angles, negative angles, and circle humor

**Features Ready to Test**:
- `"Computer rotate the square please"` ‚Üí 30¬∞ clockwise
- `"Computer rotate the triangle 45 please"` ‚Üí 45¬∞ clockwise  
- `"Computer rotate it negative 30 degrees please"` ‚Üí 30¬∞ counterclockwise
- `"Computer rotate the circle please"` ‚Üí humorous response
