- `src/types/index.ts` - Command type definitions if needed

## Session Notes

### Planning Phase ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Duration**: ~15 minutes

**Current Implementation Status Analysis**:

‚úÖ **Grammar Command Service**: `handleRotateCommand` method already exists and is well-implemented
- Supports shape/pronoun identification  
- Handles angle parsing with 90¬∞ default
- Returns properly formatted DrawCommand

‚ùå **BNF Grammar**: No rotation support in voice-commands.ne
- Need to add rotation verb and object phrases
- Need to support basic rotation, custom angles, and negative angles
- Test case exists but probably fails without grammar support

‚ùå **App.tsx**: No rotation case handling 
- Need to add `case 'rotate'` in command processing
- Need voice response for rotation confirmations

‚ùå **CanvasService**: No `rotateShape` method
- Need to implement rotation using Fabric.js capabilities
- Must maintain shape position during rotation
- Support for positive/negative angles

**Design Decisions**:

**Rotation Method Signature**:
```typescript
rotateShapeByType(shapeType: string, angle: number): boolean
```

**Grammar Structure Needed**:
```bnf
<rotate-object-phrase> ::= <pronoun-or-shape>                    // default 90¬∞
                        | <pronoun-or-shape> <fillers>? <number> // custom angle  
                        | <pronoun-or-shape> <fillers>? <number> "degrees"
                        | <pronoun-or-shape> <fillers>? "negative" <number>
                        | <pronoun-or-shape> <fillers>? "negative" <number> "degrees"
```

**Voice Responses**:
- Default: "I rotated the triangle 90 degrees"
- Custom: "I rotated the triangle 45 degrees" 
- Negative: "I rotated the triangle negative 30 degrees"

**Implementation Plan Identified**:
1. Update BNF grammar to add rotation commands
2. Implement `rotateShapeByType` in CanvasService  
3. Add rotation case handling in App.tsx
4. Test all rotation scenarios

### Lessons Learned
**Speech-to-Text Challenges**:
- Voice recognition systems frequently convert spoken words to symbols
- Preprocessing is essential for reliable grammar parsing
- Multiple format variations must be handled (spaced signs, punctuation)

**Grammar Design**:
- Default values should be set in grammar service, not App.tsx
- Clear data flow between grammar parsing and command execution
- Optional parameters require careful null handling

**Demo Design**:
- Visual feedback is crucial (30¬∞ vs 90¬∞ rotation visibility)
- Humor enhances user engagement
- Edge cases (circles) can be turned into features

### Future Development Notes
**Potential Enhancements**:
- Support for additional angle units (radians, turns)
- Visual rotation indicators or trails
- Rotation animation for smoother feedback
- Undo/redo support for rotations

**Maintenance Notes**:
- Transcript preprocessing may need updates for other speech-to-text quirks
- Grammar can be extended to support more rotation patterns
- Circle humor responses can be expanded or customized

### Technical Architecture
**Pattern Established**:
1. BNF Grammar (voice-commands.ne) ‚Üí parses natural language
2. Grammar Service (grammar-command.service.ts) ‚Üí converts to DrawCommand
3. App.tsx ‚Üí routes commands to appropriate services
4. Canvas Service ‚Üí executes visual changes
5. Voice Service ‚Üí provides audio feedback

This pattern successfully handles complex natural language commands with proper separation of concerns.

**Feature Complete**: Task 1.10 (Rotate Commands) successfully implemented with comprehensive bug fixes and enhancements. Ready for merge to main branch.
