# Task 1.8 (UI Polish and Testing) attempt 2 - Development Session

**Session Started**: 2025-07-09 18:34  
**Branch**: `feature-task-1-8-ui-polish-and-testing-attempt-2`

## Session Overview

Starting development session for Task 1.8: UI Polish and Testing (attempt 2). This is a second attempt at polishing the user interface and testing complete Phase 1 functionality after the first attempt was aborted due to transcript display complications that have since been resolved in Task 1.77 and Task 1.78.

**Current Status**: The voice-to-drawing system is fully functional with clean transcript display and production-ready logging. Ready to focus on UI improvements and comprehensive testing.

## Goals

Based on the task definition in docs/plan.md, the goals for this session are:

1. **Create status indicator component** - Visual feedback for voice recognition states
2. **Add command display component** - Show current/last commands clearly
3. **Improve overall UI design** - Polish the interface for better user experience
4. **Add help/instructions panel** - Guide users on how to use the system
5. **Test complete voice-to-drawing workflow** - Comprehensive functionality testing
6. **Fix any bugs or issues** - Address problems discovered during testing
7. **Document Phase 1 features** - Update documentation as needed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clean, professional UI
- Clear visual feedback for all states
- Complete voice-to-drawing demo works
- No major bugs or issues
