# Task 1.75: Single Shape Instance Limitation - 2025-01-07-1730

## Session Overview
**Start Time**: 2025-01-07 17:30  
**Session Type**: Development - Task Implementation  
**Branch**: `feature-task-1-75-single-shape-instance-limitation`  

## Goals
- Limit canvas to one instance per shape type (square, circle, triangle)
- Add shape existence checking before drawing new shapes
- Implement voice responses for "already exists" scenarios
- Update draw commands to handle existing shapes appropriately
- Add visual feedback showing which shapes are currently on canvas
- Create foundation for Phase 2 context-aware commands
- Eliminate ambiguity for future move/resize/color commands

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Implementation
- [x] Branch created: `feature-task-1-75-single-shape-instance-limitation`
- [ ] Analyze current canvas service shape tracking
- [ ] Modify canvas service to track shapes by type
- [ ] Update draw commands to check for existing shapes
- [ ] Add voice responses for duplicate shape scenarios
- [ ] Update visual feedback system
- [ ] Test all shape drawing scenarios

### Phase 2: Testing
- [ ] Test drawing single shapes (should work normally)
- [ ] Test drawing duplicate shapes (should give voice feedback)
- [ ] Test clear command with single-instance model
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Verify voice responses are clear and helpful
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

### Phase 3: Commit Ready
- [ ] All changes tested and working
- [ ] Voice responses implemented and tested
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Ready for user approval

### Phase 4: Merge Ready
- [ ] Final testing complete
- [ ] User approval received
- [ ] Ready to merge to main branch

## Progress Updates

### Update - 2025-01-07 6:30 PM

**Workflow Phase:** ✅ Commit Ready  
**Feature Branch:** feature-task-1-75-single-shape-instance-limitation  
**Status:** Implementation complete, committed, ready for user testing and approval  

**Summary**: Successfully implemented single shape instance limitation with enhanced voice responses and UI improvements

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: src/App.tsx (enhanced draw command handling with replacement logic)
- Modified: src/services/canvas.service.ts (added shape type tracking and single instance logic)
- Modified: src/services/response.service.ts (made getColorNameFromHex public)
- Modified: docs/plan.md (updated task status and progress tracking)
- Added: .claude/sessions/2025-01-07-1730-Task 1.75: Single Shape Instance Limitation.md
- Current branch: feature-task-1-75-single-shape-instance-limitation (commit: c608b8e)
- **Workflow Status:** ✅ All changes committed, clean working tree

**Todo Progress**: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Analyze current canvas service shape tracking
- ✓ Completed: Modify canvas service to track shapes by type
- ✓ Completed: Update draw commands to check for existing shapes
- ✓ Completed: Add voice responses for duplicate shape scenarios
- ✓ Completed: Update visual feedback system (UI messages with color names)
- ✓ Completed: Test all shape drawing scenarios

**Implementation Details**:
- **Canvas Service**: Added shapesByType Map for tracking one instance per shape type
- **Draw Methods**: Modified to return {id, wasReplaced, oldShape} for enhanced feedback
- **Voice Responses**: "I replaced the red square with a blue one" with old color information
- **UI Messages**: All messages now use color names ("blue") instead of hex ("#0000FF")
- **Helper Methods**: hasShapeType(), getShapeByType(), removeShapeByType(), getExistingShapeTypes()

**Key Features Achieved**:
- Only one square, circle, and triangle can exist at a time
- Automatic replacement with informative voice feedback
- Foundation for unambiguous Phase 2 commands ("move the square")
- Consistent color name display across UI and voice responses

**Testing Status**: Ready for user testing - implementation complete and committed
**Next Phase**: User testing and approval before merge to main
