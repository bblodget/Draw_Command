# Task 1.75: Single Shape Instance Limitation - 2025-01-07-1730

## Session Overview
**Start Time**: 2025-01-07 17:30  
**Session Type**: Development - Task Implementation  
**Branch**: `feature-task-1-75-single-shape-instance-limitation`  

## Goals
- Limit canvas to one instance per shape type (square, circle, triangle)
- Add shape existence checking before drawing new shapes
- Implement voice responses for "already exists" scenarios
- Update draw commands to handle existing shapes appropriately
- Add visual feedback showing which shapes are currently on canvas
- Create foundation for Phase 2 context-aware commands
- Eliminate ambiguity for future move/resize/color commands

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Implementation
- [x] Branch created: `feature-task-1-75-single-shape-instance-limitation`
- [ ] Analyze current canvas service shape tracking
- [ ] Modify canvas service to track shapes by type
- [ ] Update draw commands to check for existing shapes
- [ ] Add voice responses for duplicate shape scenarios
- [ ] Update visual feedback system
- [ ] Test all shape drawing scenarios

### Phase 2: Testing
- [ ] Test drawing single shapes (should work normally)
- [ ] Test drawing duplicate shapes (should give voice feedback)
- [ ] Test clear command with single-instance model
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Verify voice responses are clear and helpful
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

### Phase 3: Commit Ready
- [ ] All changes tested and working
- [ ] Voice responses implemented and tested
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Ready for user approval

### Phase 4: Merge Ready
- [ ] Final testing complete
- [ ] User approval received
- [ ] Ready to merge to main branch
