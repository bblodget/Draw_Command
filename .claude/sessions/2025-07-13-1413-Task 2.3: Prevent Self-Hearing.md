# Session: Task 2.3: Prevent Self-Hearing - 2025-07-13 14:13

## Session Overview
**Start Time**: 2025-07-13 14:13  
**Session Name**: Task 2.3: Prevent Self-Hearing  
**Branch**: feature-task-2-3-prevent-self-hearing  
**Status**: Active  

## Goals
Stop the computer's voice responses from being picked up by the transcript to prevent:
- Unintended command triggering from system speech
- Transcript pollution with system responses
- Confusion in the voice recognition system
- Poor demo experience when system "hears itself"

### Specific Objectives
1. **Implement microphone muting** during text-to-speech playback
2. **Add proper synchronization** between speech synthesis and recognition
3. **Ensure no user speech is lost** due to muting timing
4. **Add visual indicator** when system is speaking vs listening
5. **Test with various voice response lengths** and timing scenarios

## Development Workflow
- **Feature Branch**: `feature-task-2-3-prevent-self-hearing`
- **Working Directory**: Clean state, ready for implementation
- **Workflow**: Analysis â†’ Implementation â†’ Testing â†’ Commit â†’ Session Update â†’ Merge
- **Target Components**: `VoiceService`, `VoiceInterface`, speech synthesis integration

## Progress Tracking

### Implementation Strategy
**Phase 1: Analysis**
- [ ] Investigate current voice synthesis implementation
- [ ] Identify where voice responses are triggered
- [ ] Analyze speech recognition lifecycle and events
- [ ] Determine optimal muting/unmuting points

**Phase 2: Core Implementation**
- [ ] Implement microphone muting during speech synthesis
- [ ] Add speech synthesis event listeners (start/end)
- [ ] Synchronize muting with speech timing
- [ ] Ensure proper microphone reactivation

**Phase 3: UX Enhancement**
- [ ] Add visual indicator for system speaking state
- [ ] Prevent transcript updates during system speech
- [ ] Handle edge cases (speech interruption, errors)
- [ ] Test timing with various response lengths

**Phase 4: Testing & Validation**
- [ ] Test with short and long voice responses
- [ ] Verify no user speech is lost
- [ ] Test rapid command sequences
- [ ] Validate visual feedback works correctly

### Tasks Status
- [ ] Analyze current voice synthesis and recognition integration
- [ ] Implement microphone muting during text-to-speech playback  
- [ ] Add proper synchronization between speech synthesis and recognition
- [ ] Test muting/unmuting timing to ensure no user speech is lost
- [ ] Add visual indicator when system is speaking vs listening
- [ ] Test with various voice response lengths and scenarios
- [ ] User testing and approval
- [ ] Final commit and session completion

### Implementation Notes
*Ready for analysis and implementation*

### Testing Status
*Pending implementation*

### Technical Approach
Following best practices for this session:
- **Clean Interfaces**: Minimal changes to existing VoiceService API
- **Error Handling**: Proper handling of speech synthesis failures
- **Performance**: Efficient event handling without blocking
- **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback and seamless transitions
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward muting logic without complex state management

---

**Active Session**: Ready to implement self-hearing prevention for professional demo quality.

**Next Steps**: Begin with analysis of current voice synthesis implementation and identification of optimal muting points.

### Update - 2025-07-13 14:40 PM

**Workflow Phase:** Commit Ready  
**Feature Branch:** feature-task-2-3-prevent-self-hearing  
**Status:** Implementation complete, changes uncommitted, ready for user testing and commit

**Summary**: Implemented complete self-hearing prevention system with proper coordination between VoiceService and ResponseService, plus visual indicators for system speaking state.

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: src/App.tsx, src/components/VoiceInterface/index.tsx, src/components/VoiceInterface/VoiceStatusIndicator.tsx, src/services/response.service.ts, src/services/voice.service.ts
- Current branch: feature-task-2-3-prevent-self-hearing (commit: 341c670)
- **Workflow Status:** âœ… Uncommitted changes ready for testing and commit

**Todo Progress**: 5 completed, 1 in progress, 2 pending
- âœ“ Completed: Analyze current voice synthesis and recognition integration
- âœ“ Completed: Implement microphone muting during text-to-speech playback  
- âœ“ Completed: Add proper synchronization between speech synthesis and recognition
- âœ“ Completed: Add visual indicator when system is speaking vs listening
- ðŸ”„ In Progress: Test muting/unmuting timing to ensure no user speech is lost

**Implementation Details**:
1. **VoiceService Enhancement**: Added `isSystemSpeaking` tracking and `onSystemSpeakStart`/`onSystemSpeakEnd` callbacks with speech synthesis event coordination
2. **Microphone Muting Logic**: Speech recognition results are ignored when `isSystemSpeaking` is true, preventing transcript pollution
3. **Visual Feedback**: VoiceStatusIndicator now shows "System speaking..." with purple indicators during responses
4. **Service Coordination**: ResponseService now uses VoiceService.speak() method for proper coordination instead of separate speech synthesis
5. **Component Integration**: VoiceInterface passes VoiceService instance to App.tsx which provides it to ResponseService

**Testing Status**: Core implementation complete, ready for user validation that "Computer draw a red square please" properly shows system speaking state during responses

**Key Fix**: Resolved issue where status showed "Listening..." during system responses by routing all speech through coordinated VoiceService instead of separate ResponseService synthesis.
