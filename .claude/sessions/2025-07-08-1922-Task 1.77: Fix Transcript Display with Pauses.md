# Task 1.77: Fix Transcript Display with Pauses - Development Session

**Session Started**: 2025-07-08 19:22  
**Branch**: `feature-task-1-77-fix-transcript-display`

## Session Overview

Starting development session for Task 1.77: Fix Transcript Display with Pauses. This task focuses on fixing the transcript display bug where only the last speech segment appears when users pause between parts of a voice command.

**Current Status**: The system works correctly for continuous speech, but when users pause between "computer", the command, and "please", the transcript display gets overwritten with only the last segment instead of showing the complete accumulated command.

## Goals

Based on the task definition, the goals for this session are:

1. **Fix Core Bug**: Ensure transcript displays complete accumulated command throughout the entire sequence
2. **Maintain Simplicity**: Keep solution focused without complex state management or timers
3. **Preserve Existing Behavior**: "Computer" should always reset and start fresh
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify fix works with various pause patterns

**Specific Requirements**:
- "Computer" → pause → "draw a red square" → pause → "please" should show full command
- Transcript should display "computer draw a red square please" throughout
- No regression in existing functionality
- Clean, simple implementation

## Development Workflow

### Branch Management
- **Feature Branch**: `feature-task-1-77-fix-transcript-display`
- **Base Branch**: `main`
- **Target Branch**: `main` (after testing and approval)

### Workflow Steps
1. ✅ Create feature branch
2. ⏳ Analyze current transcript logic
3. ⏳ Implement transcript accumulation fix
4. ⏳ Test with various pause patterns
5. ⏳ Verify no regressions
6. ⏳ Commit changes
7. ⏳ Merge to main

### Notes
- Changes will remain uncommitted until testing is complete
- Session can be updated with `/project:session-update`
- Session can be ended with `/project:session-end`

## Progress

### Implementation Progress
- [ ] Analyze current transcript accumulation logic
- [ ] Implement proper transcript accumulation across speech pauses
- [ ] Ensure "computer" always starts fresh (reset-on-computer behavior)
- [ ] Display complete accumulated command throughout sequence
- [ ] Prevent transcript from being overwritten by final segments
- [ ] Test with various pause patterns
- [ ] Keep the solution simple and focused

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test: "Computer" → pause → "draw a red square" → pause → "please"
- [ ] Test: "Computer draw a red square please" (continuous)
- [ ] Test: Multiple "computer" resets
- [ ] Test: Various pause durations
- [ ] Test: Interrupted commands
- [ ] Test: Edge cases

### Next Steps
*Next steps will be updated as the session progresses*

**Workflow Phase:** ✅ Commit Ready
**Feature Branch:** feature-task-1-77-fix-transcript-display
**Status:** Changes committed, ready for merge

**Summary**: Successfully fixed transcript display bug with speech pauses

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: src/services/voice.service.ts
- Current branch: feature-task-1-77-fix-transcript-display (commit: 4bd53ad)
- **Workflow Status:** ✅ Changes committed and tested

**Todo Progress**: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: All transcript accumulation tasks
- ✓ Completed: Testing with various pause patterns
- ✓ Completed: No regressions found

**Testing Status**: ✅ User tested and approved - transcript display now works correctly with pauses

**Details**: Implemented clean solution with accumulatedTranscript that maintains command across speech segments. The buildDisplayTranscript() method handles accumulation elegantly, with proper reset-on-computer behavior. Solution avoids complexity and focuses on the core issue.
