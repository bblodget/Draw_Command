## Attribution

The session management command system implemented in this project is based on the 
[claude-sessions](https://github.com/iannuttall/claude-sessions) project by 
[ian nuttall](https://github.com/iannuttall), which provides custom slash commands 
for Claude Code development session tracking and documentation.

This implementation adapts and extends the original concept for use in the Robot Construction Set project.
